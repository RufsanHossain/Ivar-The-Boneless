        Ivar the Boneless (Old Norse: Ívarr hinn Beinlausi), also known as Ivar
        Ragnarsson, was a semi-legendary Viking leader who invaded England.
        According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, he was the son of Ragnar
        Loðbrok and his wife Aslaug. His brothers included Björn Ironside,
        Halfdan Ragnarsson, Hvitserk, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba.

        Ivar the Boneless was a complicated character, both in reality and in
        fiction. Ivar was painted as the villain by Christians of Old England
        and loathed by other vikings when he left for Ireland. Ivar the Boneless
        became an exceptionally violent and cruel Viking warlord, reputed to be
        a berserker. In the Sagas, Ivar the Boneless is described as being more
        like a giant than an ordinary man.

        The origin of the epithet “the Boneless” is unknown. It possibly refers
        to an inability to walk or to a skeletal condition such as osteogenesis
        imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease. Some of the legends said
        that Ivar was carried by his people when he joined the battle.
